SPOTS (fork)<br>
=====<br>
Based on SPOTS (Simple Project Organizational Tool for Scanlation) is a Project Management System designed specifically for use with scanlation.<br>
<br>
The aim of this system is to provide a more structured approach to series, task and role management within scanlation teams by providing simple management tools.<br>

<h3>This project is still under heavy development and not yet ready for real world use</h3>

<h2>How it works</h2>

When SPOTS is set up, an administrator account is created.<br>
The default administrator can then begin creating other users, adding series, specifying roles, and so on.<br>
Once the ground work has been completed, work can begin.<br>
<br>
The usual process is something along the lines of:<br>
<ul>
<li>A series is created</li>
<li>The series is assigned a project manager</li>
<li>The project manager or an admin creates the necessary tasks for the chapter</li>
<li>Members are assigned to each task</li>
<li>The assigned members update their tasks as they progress</li>
<li>When all tasks are complete, the chapter is ready for release</li>
</ul>
There is some variation to this process.<br>
For example, a series can have tasks created automatically, and tasks for a series can have staff members assigned automatically.<br>

<h2>Terminology</h2>

<h3>Tasks</h3>
A "task" is a role attributed to a specific chapter.<br>
<br>
For example, a new chapter of Series A might need translating, cleaning, and typesetting.<br>
In that case, you would create a task for translating, one for cleaning, and one for typesetting.<br>
The "tasks" would then be assigned to the team members expected to fill each role, and would be updated as the task progresses. eg. the translator may update their task to "complete" when they're finished translating, or the cleaner might update their task to "stalled" and list the reason as being that they need help with redraws, at which point a new task for Redraws would be created and assigned.<br>

<h3>Roles</h3>
In order to better manage team members and assign tasks, there exist specific roles that can be used.<br>
These roles are not set in stone; they can be added and removed by an Admin.<br>
<br>
Each team member can have roles assigned to them. These roles determine:<br>
a) what tasks a team member can work on, and<br>
b) what tasks a team member is shown when searching for work.<br>
<br>
Roles are also assigned to tasks, thus allowing members to search for and manage work.<br>
Unlike a member, however, a task can only have one role assigned to it.<br>

<h3>Members</h3>
Scanlation team members are each given an account.<br>
That account can then be linked to a project or specific task by an Admin or Project Manager.<br>
The team member will then have the ability to update the task to reflect their progress, or to indicate that they need help.<br>
<br>
Normal team members can only update tasks they are attached to.<br>
Project Managers can create and modify tasks of any series of which they are the project manager, as well as update series info (eg. upload a thumbnail for the series, change the series' description, etc.)<br>
Administrators can do anything.<br>

<h3>Series</h3>
As the name suggests, a series represents a manga, manhwa, etc. series that a scanlation group is working on.<br>
Each series will have a project manager, an image representing the series (ie. a thumbnail), and information pertaining to the series, such as a description, its genres, etc.<br>
<br>
Series can be marked as public (ie. viewable to guests) and adult (a warning for people unwilling to read adult content).<br>
Series will also remain searchable, represented by their name and thumbnail, and provide links to be read online and downloaded, if desired.<br>
<br>
A series can also have "default" members and tasks assigned to it.<br>
For example, most series will have text and thus require translating, so such series would have "translation" tasks setup by default. Such a series would also require cleaning and typesetting, perhaps proofreading, so two or three other default tasks might be assigned.<br>
If a particular series always has the same translator, you could further specify which translator should be assigned to the task. Thus, with every new chapter added to the series, the translator would automatically be attached to the new chapter and have a task assigned to them.<br>

<h3>Chapters</h3>
A chapter represents (duh) one chapter of a series.<br>
This chapter then has tasks assigned to it, thus indicating how far through the team is with that particular chapter.<br>
Chapters are created manually, but can have tasks assigned to them automatically, as detailed earlier.<br>
